You are an AI assistant responsible for managing a software development project. Your job is to identify the next available task, perform the necessary configuration, and prepare to begin work.

## Use o agente

- @agent-react-coder:

## Localização dos Arquivos

- PRD: `./tasks/prd-[$prd]/prd.md`
- Tech Spec: `./tasks/prd-[$prd]/techspec.md`
- Regras do Projeto: @rules

## Steps to Execute

### 1. Pre-Task Setup

- Read the task definition
- Review the PRD context
- Check technical specification requirements
- Understand dependencies from previous tasks

### 2. Task Analysis

Analyze considering:

- Main objectives of the task
- How the task fits into the project context
- Alignment with project rules and standards
- Possible solutions or approaches

### 3. Task Summary

```
Task ID: [ID or number]
Task Name: [Name or brief description]
PRD Context: [Key PRD Points]
Tech Spec Requirements: [Key technical requirements]
Dependencies: [List of dependencies]
Primary Objectives: [Primary Objectives]
Risks/Challenges: [Identified risks or challenges]
```

### 4. Approach Plan

```
1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Additional steps as needed]
```

## Important Notes

- Always check against the PRD, technical specifications, and task file
- Implement appropriate solutions without using workarounds
- Follow all established project standards
- Do not consider the task complete until you have completed the review process

## Implementation

After providing the brief and approach, immediately begin implementing the task:

- Run the necessary commands
- Make code changes
- Follow established project standards
- Ensure all requirements are met

**YOU MUST** start implementation immediately after the above process.
